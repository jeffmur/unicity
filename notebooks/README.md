### Precison.ipynb
> Precison Tests
- Farther away from true (5 digit precion), the more similar users tend to sway. 

### Spacial.ipynb 
> Finding the optimal bounding box 
- Granular vs. Coarse location modeling 

### Temporal.ipynb
> Time ranges (day, month, year)
- Sampling dates for trace comparison????

### Santization 
- Input: Raw set  
- preprocessing from geoLife to useful data 
- Output: user_by_month, single file 

### Pre-processing 
- Bounding Box (Spatial)
- Filtering by date (Temporal)
- sample files for class demo (7z)
!! Assumption: Students will run this off laptops

### Image Generation / Visualation with geopy
- Not heavy focus
- geopy for Point() -> html??? Looks good
- Good for verification 

### Unicity Calcuation 
- Progess: Working Spatio only trajectories 
- Out-of-Scope: Trajectories per time sample (set of N traces within 1 week)
